# cheat-sheet-html

Welcome to my cheat sheet about html!

I have realized it as part of my training in Simplon School that is also called a social firm of Web developer. You can visit @ http://simplon.co/roubaix/ and at http://simplon.co/

This task has been done with the foundation framework as requested by our tutors.

Feel free to use it and abuse it if you are suffering of C.R.S. :-)))
Hope it would be useful and you will enjoy it.
